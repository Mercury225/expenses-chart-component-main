## General Comments
- Feel free to suggest advise!
- loved the addition of a javascript element, lots of fun making charts

## Things to work on/ ask about
- i used flex a lot on this project ( see html that says horizontally/vertically for different flex directions), i did use some CSS magic to get the brown popup by reversing the flex direction (see vertical-reverse), i was wondering if there was a better way to code this
- also wondering if my js code can be cleaned up in fewer lines.
- looking for a better way to name my html tags, can anyone suggest a good naming system?
